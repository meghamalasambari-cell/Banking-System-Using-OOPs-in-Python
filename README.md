# Banking-System-Using-OOPs-in-Python
🏦 # OOPS – Banking System 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts in building a simple Banking System. It models Savings Accounts and Current Accounts, handling deposits, withdrawals, interest calculations, overdraft facilities, and secure balance management.

🚀 Features

Encapsulation → Private balance (__balance) with secure access.

Inheritance → SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount extend BankAccount.

Polymorphism → withdraw() behaves differently for each account type.

Deposit & Withdraw operations with error handling.

Interest calculation for Savings Accounts.

Overdraft facility for Current Accounts.

Scalability → Can be extended to Loan Accounts, Fixed Deposits, etc.

📂 Repository Contents

OOPS_Banking_System.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with complete code and examples.

OOPS_Banking_System_PPT.pptx → PowerPoint presentation explaining the project.

README.md → Documentation of the project.

🖥️ Example Demonstrations

Deposit: Ravi deposits 2000 → Balance = 2000

Withdraw (Savings): Sneha with 5000 tries 10000 → Fails (no overdraft)

Interest: Arjun with 10000 → New Balance = 10500

Overdraft (Current): Priya with 2000 withdraws 6000 → Allowed (within overdraft limit)

🎯 Real-World Applications

Base for modern banking apps, ATMs, digital wallets.

Can integrate with databases & APIs.

Secure design prevents unauthorized balance modification.

📖 Key Learnings

Implementing Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

Using method overriding for flexibility.

Working with private variables & name mangling.

Building scalable, secure, and reusable OOPS code.

📝 How to Use

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/oops-banking-system.git cd oops-banking-system

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook OOPS_Banking_System.ipynb

Run the code cells to test deposits, withdrawals, interest, and overdraft.

Open the PPT (OOPS_Banking_System_PPT.pptx) to view the project presentation.
